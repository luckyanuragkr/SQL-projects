**Online Voting System**

Overview

The Online Voting System is designed to facilitate the election process for student unions or similar organizations. This system allows voters to cast their ballots online, ensuring a secure, efficient, and transparent election process. The project includes the design and implementation of database tables, an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, a relational schema, and SQL queries to manage the election data.

Project Structure
Tables and Attributes: The database is structured with several tables, each containing specific attributes necessary for the voting system:

Voter: Stores voter information such as Voter ID, Name, Date of Birth, and Department.
Candidate: Contains details of candidates including Candidate ID, Post ID, Name, Date of Birth, Party, and Department.
Post: Defines the different posts available for the election, identified by Post ID and Post Name.
Administration: Manages voter credentials with Token ID, Voter ID, and Password.
Ballot: Records the voting process by linking Voter ID, Token ID, Candidate ID, and Post ID.
Result: Holds the election results with Token ID, Candidate ID, and Post ID.
ER Diagram: An Entity-Relationship diagram visually represents the relationships between the entities (tables) within the database. It helps in understanding how data flows through the system and how different tables interact with each other.

Relational Schema: The relational schema is a blueprint of the database structure, showcasing how the tables are related and ensuring data integrity through primary and foreign keys.

SQL Queries: A set of SQL queries is provided to interact with the database, enabling tasks such as inserting data, retrieving results, and updating records.

Reverse Engineering: The project includes a reverse engineering process to derive the ER diagram and relational schema from existing database tables. This ensures that the design remains consistent with the implemented database.

How to Use
Set Up the Database: Create the necessary tables in your database using the provided schema. Ensure all relationships and constraints are correctly implemented.
Insert Data: Use the SQL queries to populate the tables with initial data such as voter and candidate details.
Run the Election: Voters can log in using their credentials to cast their votes. The system records each vote in the Ballot table.
Calculate Results: The system processes the votes to determine the winning candidates for each post, which are then stored in the Result table.
View Results: Authorized users can query the Result table to view the election outcomes.
Technical Details
Database: The project relies on a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage election data.
SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is used for all database operations, including data manipulation and retrieval.
Security: Voter credentials are managed securely through the Administration table, ensuring that only authorized users can access the voting system.
Conclusion
The Online Voting System provides a comprehensive solution for managing student union elections, from voter registration to result calculation. By leveraging a well-structured database and robust SQL queries, this system ensures a seamless and secure election process.
